# Team HARL

## Description
This is a simple to do list that allows the user to add tasks. Once an item is marked as 'done', the task will be move to the 'Done' list.


## User Stories
#### Core
As a busy person, I want to:
- Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them
- Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done
- Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore

As a motor-impaired user, I want to:
- Use all the features of the app without a mouse

#### Stretch
As a busy person, I want to:
- Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what's left to do

#### Acceptance Criteria
- A working to-do list
- Tests for (at least) each user story
- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible

#### Testing Methods
TDD 
Unit Testing
